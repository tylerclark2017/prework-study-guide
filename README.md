# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this project as a first attempt at learning how to code in git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to prove to myself that I could do it. The prework study guide allows me to not only prove that I can indeed code, but gives me an overview of some important notes that will help me throughout the bootcamp. I learned not only how to code, but about each language and how they are all used to create webpages and interact with each other.
